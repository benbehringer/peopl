PEoPLâ€“Projectional Editing of Product Lines
===========

To install: visit http://peopl.de for instructions!

At this point we have a stable version in the main branch that requires a modified version of MPS (see http://peopl.de). The branch [peopl-2018.3.3](https://github.com/benbehringer/peopl/tree/peopl-2018.3.3) provides a more advanced version (still to be fully migrated to MPS 2018.3.3), which does not require a modified version of MPS and supports mbeddr C (http://mbeddr.com).

For more information please visit http://peopl.de

Notice that the main branch version only supports BaseLanguage (Java) requiring the extension of

1. jetbrains.mps.baseLanguage
2. com.mbeddr.mpsutil.projectview.runtime
3. de.itemis.msp.selection.runtime
